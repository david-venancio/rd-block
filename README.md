# RD-BLOCK : Rhombic Dodecahedron (Truss-style & cutted in half)

= 3D-printed building block that doesn't need supports and is lightweight !

You can stack the blocks by matching lozenge faces or the flat unique face created by the cut.

Perfectly stackable because it's based on Rhombic Dodecahedron (a Catalan Solid).

I cutted it in half to enable anyone to use it as the first step of the "building".

You can turn each block on all axis and imagine what you can do with a lot of them !

The scale of the mesh can be modified when you 3d-print, of course, but novices in 3d-print don't know that's so easy, so I have to insist on that argument : anyone can print it at the needed size.

I suggest to check what size you get at 100% (small on purpose when loaded on slic3r) or 5000%, then 3D-print it and "play" with it. This is very important: at small scales the bars -or poles- get too thin and weak and could be enlarged. At the opposite, with big scales the bars could be thiner depending on the extruded material... You should try some mechanical stress-tests (in all cases btw). Use at your own risk ! I'm not responsible of the real objects uses and maybe fails. I'm not saying and cannot guarantee that the produced objects are unbreakable !
